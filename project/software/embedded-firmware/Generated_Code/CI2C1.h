** ===================================================================
**     Method      :  CI2C1_SendChar (component InternalI2C)
**     Description :
**         When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit
**         addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes
**         inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one
**         character (byte) to the bus. The slave address must be
**         specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10"
**         method or in the component initialization section, "Target
**         slave address init" property. If interrupt service is
**         enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that
**         transmission was successful. The state of transmission is
**         obtainable from (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost)
**         events. 
**         When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a character to
**         the internal output slave buffer and, after the master
**         starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no character is
**         ready for a transmission (internal output slave buffer is
**         empty), the Empty character will be sent (see "Empty
**         character" property).
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         Chr             - Character to send.
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - Error code, possible codes:
**                           ERR_OK - OK
**                           ERR_SPEED - This device does not work in
**                           the active speed mode
**                           ERR_DISABLED -  Device is disabled
**                           ERR_BUSY - The slave device is busy, it
**                           does not respond by an acknowledge (only in
**                           master mode and when interrupt service is
**                           disabled)
**                           ERR_BUSOFF - Clock timeout elapsed or

**                           ERR_TXFULL - Transmitter is full (slave

**     Method      :  CI2C1_SendBlock (component InternalI2C)
**     Description :
**         When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit
**         addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes
**         inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the
**         block of characters to the bus. The slave address must be
**         specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SlaveSelect10"
**         method or in component initialization section, "Target slave
**         address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and
**         the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission
**         was successful. The state of transmission is detectable by
**         means of events (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost).
**         Data to be send is not copied to an internal buffer and
**         remains in the original location. Therefore the content of
**         the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is
**         complete. Event OnTransmitData can be used to detect the end
**         of the transmission.
**         When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a block of
**         characters to the internal output slave buffer and then,
**         after the master starts the communication, to the I2C bus.
**         If no character is ready for a transmission (internal output
**         slave buffer is empty), the "Empty character" will be sent
**         (see "Empty character" property). In SLAVE mode the data are
**         copied to an internal buffer, if specified by "Output buffer
**         size" property.
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**       * Ptr             - Pointer to the block of data to send.
**         Siz             - Size of the block.
**       * Snt             - Amount of data sent (moved to a buffer).
**                           In master mode, if interrupt support is
**                           enabled, the parameter always returns the
